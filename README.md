# BioLamp

An exploratory project on the synthesis of computer and biological algorithms.
Inspired by Christopher Voigt's work in synthetic biology

Questions:
What useful data can we gain from simulations of genetic networks?
What operations can biological logic gates perform?
How might we model chemical pathways in a cell? Which models are more accurate?

*An extension of the Kaggle "Human Protein Atlas Image Classification" competition*
